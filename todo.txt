- Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, such as
  a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. Can you
  control the objectâ€™s motion by only manipulating the acceleration? Try to give the
  creature a personality through its behavior (rather than through its visual design).
